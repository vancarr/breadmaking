     <p>My whole bread journey began at a house party.</p>
     <p>The drinks were strong, my friends- the hosts- were occupied, and the apartment was crowded.</p>
     <p>I was stuck in the kitchen and my only option for entertainment was to talk to a stranger.</p>
     <p>A stranger who made his own bread. Daily. With his own sourdough starter.</p>
     <p><em>"It's really easy. Anyone can make bread."</em></p>
     <p>I took that as a <em>challenge.</em> A few weeks later, instead of buying a baguette the next time I planned spaghetti dinner, I looked up a bread recipe.</p> 
     <p>Then another bread recipe because no one has time to let bread rise for 8 hours. Then another because it's 7pm and no body got time at 2 hour bread recipe. I eventually settled on a 1 hour recipe.</p>
     <p> The bread was... edible. But I knew I could do better. So I tried again.</p>
     <p>And again.</p>
     <p>Trying different techniques, buying more equipement, trying different recipes.</p>
     <p>I needed somewhere to put all my notes about bread. So I picked it as the topic for my coding class personal project.</p>
     <p>And the rest is history. Enjoy!</p>
